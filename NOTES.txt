A project to exercise fs-entries to build the framework for a Haskell
project.

I need to not have the Config value hard-coded.

If I'm building an app, enforce a structure.

Be able to pass in dependencies.

Be able to pass in github dependencies:
https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/yaml_configuration.md

I'd love a GUI, but Haskell.  (Java?  Take a JSON structure streamed
as input if no config file mentioned?)

I don't think I need the yaml library.  I'm just constructing stuff
and I could do that by hand.
